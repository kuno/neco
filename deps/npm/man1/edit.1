.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Opens the package folder in the default editor (or whatever you\'ve
configured as the npm \fBeditor\fR config \-\- see \fBnpm help config\fR\|\.)

After it has been edited, the package is rebuilt so as to pick up any
changes in compiled packages\.

Note: If you\'re finding yourself using this a lot, it\'s probably better
to use \fBnpm link\fR instead\.  However, it is extremely handy when used in
conjunction with \fBnpm bundle\fR\|\.

For instance, you can do \fBnpm bundle install connect\fR to install connect
into your package, and then \fBnpm bundle edit connect\fR to make a few
changes to your locally bundled copy\.
