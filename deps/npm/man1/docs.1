.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This command tries to guess at the likely location of a package\'s
documentation URL, and then tries to open it using the \fB\-\-browser\fR
config param, which defaults to \fB"open"\fR because that works on a mac\.
.
.P
This is an experimental command\.  It may disappear or change radically\.
